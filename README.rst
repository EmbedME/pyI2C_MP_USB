pyI2C_MP_USB
============

pyI2C_MP_USB is a Python library for the I2C-MP-USB (https://www.fischl.de/i2c-mp-usb/) adapter which allows easy, platform-independent access to IÂ²C slaves. The API is mostly identical to the SMBus package, porting of the control source code to other hardware is therefore possible without much effort.
